# Product_Review-NLP
📝 Mini Project 1: Basics of NLP – Text Cleaning & Vectorization
📌 Project Overview

This project introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentals by performing text cleaning, preprocessing, and vectorization on customer review data. The aim is to build an AI-driven sentiment classification model that automatically identifies whether a review expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

💼 Business Context

In today’s e-commerce ecosystem, customer reviews directly impact product perception and buying decisions. Manual monitoring of reviews becomes unsustainable with business growth.
This project demonstrates how NLP and Machine Learning can help:

Detect customer complaints early

Reduce churn and improve customer retention

Protect brand reputation

Drive better decision-making through sentiment insights

📊 Dataset

Product ID → Unique identifier for each product

Product Review → Customer feedback text

Sentiment → Label (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
